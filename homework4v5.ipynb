        "XGBoost achieved the best results. Boosting methods (XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost) improved over Random Forest. Both Random Forest and Boosting fixed Decision Tree's overfitting issue. A single Decision Tree is very prone to overfitting because it learns the training data too specifically, including noise. This leads to high variance, meaning it fails to generalize well to unseen test data. Random Forest combines multiple Decision Trees using bagging (Bootstrap Aggregation). Each tree is trained on a random subset of the data, which reduces overfitting. The final prediction is the average of all trees, leading to a more stable and generalized model. On the other hand, Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost) is different from Random Forest because it builds trees sequentially, not in parallel. Instead of averaging all trees, each new tree focuses on correcting errors made by the previous ones. This leads to lower bias and variance, improving generalization."
